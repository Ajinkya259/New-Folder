        <h3>Khajuraho Group of Monuments</h3>
        <p><strong>The temples at Khajuraho were built during the Chandella dynasty, which reached its apogee between 950 and 1050. Only about 20 temples remain; they fall into three distinct groups and belong to two different religions – Hinduism and Jainism.
             They strike a perfect balance between architecture and sculpture. The Temple of Kandariya is decorated with a profusion of sculptures that are among the greatest masterpieces of Indian art.The group of temples of Khajuraho testifies to the culmination 
             of northern Indian temple art and architecture of the Chandella dynasty who ruled the region in the 10th and 11th centuries CE. Distributed over an area of 6 square km in a picturesque landscape, the 23 temples (including one partly excavated structure) 
             that form the western, eastern, and southern clusters of the Khajuraho Group of Monuments are rare surviving examples that display the originality and high quality of Nagara-style temple architecture.The Khajuraho Group of Monuments demonstrates in layout 
             and physical form, the pinnacle of temple architectural development in northern India. Built in sandstone, each temple is elevated from its environs by a highly ornate terraced platform.</strong></p>

            <h3>Lakshmana Temple</h3>
            <span class="desc">One of the oldest structures amongst the temple groups of Khajuraho, Lakshmana Temple was built by the Chandela kings. The divine trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva graces the entrance of the temple, though the temple is really dedicated to the Hindu Lord Vishnu, and harbours a portrayal of Vaikuntha-Vishnu as its sanctum. 

                The exceptional architecture is enhanced by over 600 deities whose images are aesthetically showcased on the exteriors of the temple.

            <h3>Matangeshwar Temple</h3>
            <span class="desc">Matangeshwar Temple Overview
                Established by Chandra Dev of the Chandela dynasty in the ninth century, the temple was built as a shrine of Lord Shiva, housing an eight feet tall Shiva Lingam crafted with yellow limestone. The morning aarti is a delightful experience.
                
                Unlike its neighbouring temples, the pillars are quite plain, while the roof is beautifully blanketed with figures. It is truly one of the best places to visit in Khajuraho.

                A long-standing reflection of the Indo-Aryan architectural style, the temple is embellished with gorgeous ancient sculptures and images of Yakshis. Though partly in ruins now, the feeling of awe that one feels here is gripping.
