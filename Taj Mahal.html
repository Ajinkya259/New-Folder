        <h3>Taj Mahal</h3>
        <p><strong>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
            
            The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</strong></p>

            <h3>Agra Fort</h3>
            <span class="desc">This UNESCO Word Heritage site is one of the most robust and important Mughal forts in India. After arriving in Agra in 1558, Emperor Akbar extensively rebuilt the fort using red sandstone. The process took eight years and was completed in 1573. The fort retained its stature until Shah Jahan shifted the Mughal capital from Agra to Delhi in 1638. It lost much of its grandeur after his death in 1666, and during the 18th century was repetitively invaded and captured. Finally, it fell into the hands of the British in 1803. Although many of the buildings inside the fort have been destroyed, some mosques, public and private audience halls, fairy-tale palaces, towers, and courtyards still remain. Another attraction is the evening sound and light show that recreates the fort's history. If budget is a concern, it's advisable to skip the less-impressive Red Fort in Delhi in favor of Agra Fort. </span>

            <h3>Agra's Other Tombs</h3>
            <span class="desc">Agra has two significant tombs, with impressive Islamic-style architecture, that existed before the Taj Mahal but have subsequently been overshadowed by it. One of them contains the body of Emperor Akbar, widely considered to be the most influential Mughal emperor. It was completed in 1614 and is situated in Sikandra, on the northwest outskirts of Agra on the road to Mathura.. His wife's body is housed in another tomb nearby, with a similar entrance fee.

                The tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah was the first to be made out of white marble (instead of the red sandstone typical of Mughal architecture) and is often referred to as the "Baby Taj". It's located amid a small garden alongside the Yamuna River, and contains the body of Mirza Ghiyas Beg who served under Akbar. His daughter married Akbar's son, Jehangir, and he was later appointed chief minister.</span>

            <h3>Mehtab Bagh</h3>
            <span class="desc">Don’t want to pay the hefty admission fee or battle the crowds to visit the Taj Mahal? Or, simply want an alternative perspective of it? You can clearly see the Taj from across the river bank. One such place with a view to remember is Mehtab Bagh, the "Moonlight Garden". This 25 acre Mughal garden complex is situated directly opposite the monument and was actually built before the Taj, by Emperor Babur (the founder of the Mughal Empire). It fell into ruin but has been beautifully reconstructed. The entry cost is 300 rupees for foreigners and 25 rupees for Indians, and it's open until sunset.</span>

            <h3>Mughal Heritage</h3>
            <span class="desc"> The Mughal Heritage Walk is a community-based tourism initiative that was started by CURE (Center for Urban and Regional Excellence) to help villagers make an income from tourism and improve their living conditions. This 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) walk is conducted by villagers who have been trained as tour guides. It takes place on the riverside opposite the Taj Mahal, goes through Kachhpura village, and ends at Mehtab Bagh. You'll get to visit a number of lesser-known monuments of the Mughal Era in a rural setting, interact with the village communities, and enjoy a fabulous view of the Taj Mahal as well. </span>
